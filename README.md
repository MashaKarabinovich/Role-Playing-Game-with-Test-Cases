# Role-Playing-Game-with-Test-Cases

This was a project that I did with Software Testing where I was given some Test cases(from a random person) and I had
to use the test cases to make something out of it. 

In this case the test cases were towards a role playing game, so I had to create a main class with objects
and manipulate them to satisfy the test cases.

I also had to create my own test cases using Logic Coverage, Syntax Coverage, and Graph Coverage for Testing.

All of this was done in C#/Visual Studio with implemented NUnit.
